<p>Lights by the Lake 2024 presents a captivating gala of lights, music,
and cultural delights. Join us at Jurong Lake Gardens for a 15-day celebration
of the Mid-Autumn Festival, featuring the 21st edition of our NParks Concert
Series in the Park: Rockestra®. Themed ‘Moonlit Melodies’, our talented
line-up of local artistes will be performing a selection of popular Mandarin
and English songs. In support of the President’s Challenge 2024, there
will also be fun charity booths where visitors can contribute to the initiative.</p>
<p>Be awed by this year’s lantern displays, which beautifully showcase the
biodiversity of the gardens by enhancing the colours and shapes of the
flora and fauna, as well as the gardens’ iconic buildings! Not only will
the ever-popular floating lanterns return to our waters, but there will
also be new designs inspired by origami, as well as mesmerising light and
projection shows.</p>
<p>In addition to the enchanting lantern displays, there will also be cultural
showcases and music performances, as well as entertaining carnival games
for some family-friendly fun. You can also catch a free movie screening
while relishing in a delectable selection of street food!</p>
