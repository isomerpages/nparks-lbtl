<p>The President’s Challenge focuses on supporting the underprivileged communities
in Singapore through volunteering and public donations.</p>
<p>In support of the Challenge this year, there will be fun activity booths
where visitors can contribute to the initiative by purchasing <strong>floating water lanterns</strong>, <strong>3D-printed souvenirs </strong>inspired
by the diverse wildlife found in Jurong Lake Gardens, and <strong>solar-powered tulips </strong>that
light up with a gentle, ambient glow. Additionally, there will be <strong>photo opportunities with various festive backdrops</strong>,
transforming ordinary snapshots into extraordinary adventures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The President’s Challenge 2024 activities are jointly organised by National
Parks Board, South West Community Development Council (South West CDC),
and A-Smart Media Pte Ltd.  All proceeds from the sale of items at the
activity booths will go to the President’s Challenge Charity Fund.&nbsp;</p>
